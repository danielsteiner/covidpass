# COVID PASS

This tool parses official EU COVID-19 Certificates issued as proof of vaccination or test. Unfortunately, I don't have any certificates that proove that I had covid thus I can't check if those work as well. 

This tool currently supports:

* Vaccination certifcates
* Test certificates by:
  * MA15 Gesundheitsdienst der Stadt Wien
  * LifeBrain
  * Rotes Kreuz LifeBrain GmbH
  * Nieder√∂sterreich Testet

other test centres would propably work but i suspect that some minor tweaking is needed as the code for data extraction relies on line numbers.

Feel free to submit changes to reflect those certificates!
